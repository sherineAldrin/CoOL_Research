#### This is a python script to do the following:
1. Splits the OMG 2016 and 2017 data by month (September and October)
2. Makes a plot of the Ecco and OMG CTD data from a depth POV at a specific point
   (Makes a plot for each OMG CTD file, comparing the temperatures and salinities at the closest recorded ECCO point)
3. Plots the avergae temperature and salinity for each dataset
4. Makes a summary csv file with the data
5. Makes two conclusive histograms about the recorded averages for temperature and salinity

#### Usage
Make sure to have the OMG 2016 and 2017 data, as well as the respective ECCO THETA and SALT files. Replace the file paths as needed.

#### Output
Included are the two histograms and the csv file, but the plots sorted by month and year for each OMG file will be a result as well.
