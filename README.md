### CoOL Research Repository Details

This repo is for my research in Mike Wood's Computational Oceanography Lab.

My job is to compare various data sets' accuracy to his own Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) data. I'm using different tools such as Python in Jupyter Notebooks, Panoply, and QGIS to analyze
and visualize the data. The code I've written and the output is in this repository, and it should be reproducible given the correct data is used.
